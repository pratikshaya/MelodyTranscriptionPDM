function [ transcribedDataRefined ] = noteRefinement( transcribedData,threshold)
%NOTEREFINEMENT This is to refine the notes from the HMM output. Basically,
%it start from the shortest note, calculate the weights of this shortest
%note to its previous and subsequent note, and decide which note it should
%be added to.
%   Input
%   @transcribedData: the transcribed note data. [start time:end time:MIDI]
%   @threshold: this is the threshold to classify whose duration lower than
%   this is deemed as short note.
%   Output
%   @transcribedDataRefined: the refined transcribed data. [start time:end time:MIDI]
